        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Huijuan Huang and I am 18 years old. I am originally from Los Angeles, California. 
        I am currently a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside. Originally, I wanted to major in 
        Environmental Science because I was interested in helping maintain the health of our planet. However, as time passed, 
        I realized that my passion is helping people, so I decided to major in Sociology. I am planning to double major in 
        Sociology as well in Environmental Science, or maybe to minor in Environmental Science. I want to be able to understand 
        our society better to help fight for the future of our planet. I believe that those two are important because we need to 
        understand the behaviors of societies to know what we need to change. We need to understand what problems are caused by societies, 
        so we can implement policies and changes to help solve environmental issues.<br><br>

        In high school, I used to be a part of the Environmental Science Club where I helped create a more sustainable environment for our school. 
        I became interested in Environmental Science in junior year of high school when I took AP Environmental Science. It was the first 
        time that I learned about some of the environmental issues that have been going on for a long time. I felt that I needed to do 
        something before the human species destroyed the future of the planet. From that point on, I knew that I wanted to have a career 
        in Environmental Science. I became interested in Sociology during senior year of high school when a guest speaker came to one of my
        classes and talked about her experience working for an NGO. She worked in a remote village in South America helping the local people. 
        I became intrigued by working for an NGO abroad, so I decided that I want to major in Sociology in college.<br><br>

        In the future, I want to work for an NGO, helping out local people in less developed countries. I am very intrigued about the work of 
        those working in NGOs because they are providing essential services to people that are in less fortunate situations. In the future, I 
        want to work with people in a remote village in Africa and provide help to make their lives easier. However, I do not mind what the 
        location is as long as I can help people. I am currently looking to gain experience by volunteering at the American Red Cross. Once I get back on
        campus after the virus, I plan to volunteer at a local food bank or soup kitchen to give back and help out the less fortunate. I enjoy 
        helping out people, so I think that majoring in Sociology will give me the opportunity of fulfilling my passion of helping out people. 
        My main goal in life is to help solve environmental issues that we are facing right now by learning the behaviors of societies around the world.
